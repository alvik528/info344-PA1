Implementing all the code using Amazon's Web Service proved to be a difficult task. The first task that needed to be done was to set up Amazon Web Service's EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud) to host a public dns where our site would be. The proper settings that needed to be selected were picking a SUSE linux enterprise server with cloudwatch, and created a security group that would allow 3 ports, 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP, and 3306 for MySQL. I then created a keypair and there began my struggle to ssh into the server. When I started I needed to use 2 commands to finally get into the server, with some difficulties with my public key, then I ran the code listed in awssetup, to download apache, mysql, and yast2.
